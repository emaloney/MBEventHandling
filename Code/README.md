The Mockingbird Event Handling module extends the Mockingbird Data Environment by adding the ability to declare *listeners* that can process *actions* in response to `NSNotification` events.

[The MBEventHandling project documentation](https://github.com/emaloney/MBEventHandling/blob/master/README.md) on GitHub provides a high-level overview of how to use the Mockingbird Event Handling module in your application.

Documentation for the public API appears below.
