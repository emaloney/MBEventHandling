Mockingbird Event Handling Module
=================================
The Mockingbird Event Handling Module adds to [the Mockingbird Data Environment](https://github.com/emaloney/MBDataEnvironment) the ability to create *listeners* for `NSNotification` events and perform  *actions* in response to specific events.

**Note:** This open-source project is a pre-release version. We reserve the right to make breaking changes at any time prior to the 1.0.0 release without observing the usual CocoaPod versioning conventions. If that's a problem for you, please lock to a specific version of this CocoaPod.
